**Homework for 5th Lecture: Collections in Java**
---

### Exercise 1: Introduction to Lists
**Task:** Create an `ArrayList` and populate it with 10 random numbers. Print out every number in an even index.
**Explanation:** This exercise will familiarize you with the basics of list operations and how to manipulate data within lists.

---

### Exercise 2: Dive Deep into Sets
**Task:** Use a `HashSet` to store a series of book titles. Make sure to add duplicate titles, and then print out the set to see which titles are unique.
**Explanation:** This exercise is meant to illustrate the property of sets that prevents them from storing duplicate data.

---

### Exercise 3: Map Out Your Learning
**Task:** Create a `HashMap` wherein keys are student names and values are their grades. Display all students who scored above 90.
**Explanation:** This task will teach you how to store key-value pairs in a map and how to filter data based on certain criteria.

---

### Exercise 4: Queues and Dequeues
**Task:** Implement a `LinkedList` as a queue. Add five elements, dequeue two, then enqueue three more. Display the queue after every operation.
**Explanation:** Through this exercise, you'll learn about the FIFO (First In, First Out) nature of queues and how to manage data using the queue data structure.

---

### Exercise 5: Complex Collections
**Task:** Create a `HashMap` wherein keys are countries and values are another `HashMap` containing information like capital and population. Add details for three countries and display them.
**Explanation:** This exercise teaches you how to use nested collections in Java to store more complex hierarchical data.

---

### Exercise 6: Collections Utility Functions
**Task:** Use the Collections utility class to sort an `ArrayList` of numbers in descending order and then shuffle them randomly. Print out the list after each operation.
**Explanation:** Here, you'll learn about the utility functions that Java provides to easily manipulate data within collections.
